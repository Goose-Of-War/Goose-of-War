## Introduction: 

I am Vidunram, a third-year undergraduate student at IIT Kharagpur. I mostly work on the backend of small projects, mainly in Python and Javascript. I am currently the Head of the Web Development Team of the [Manga and Anime Society Kharagpur](https://github.com/kgpmask) or simply MASK.

## Experience

My coding journey properly started in the 11th grade (though I've had instances to code in 6th and 8th classes respectively, and no I am not talking about HTML). Since then, it has been a hell of a ride, learning new things, trying more things in what I know and don't know, and so on. 

### Technical Skills

- Backend development (for web servers)
- API Handling
- Automation scripting

### Programming Languages

I have worked with quite a few languages when it comes to programming, be it just learning the basics or extensively working using it in projects.  
Here are the ones I have worked with the most:  
- **Javascript:** With roughly a year's experience in it, I learned Javascript in order to work on the [MASK Website](https://github.com/kgpmask/MASK). Now, it's just _the_ language I am using the most, be it to write some small scripts to fetch/calculate stuff or to make full-fledged projects.
- **Python:** Started learning this as a part of the school's Computer Science curriculum, I have roughly three years of experience in Python. Needless to say, it has served as a foundation for my coding skills (ironic since people generally feel otherwise) and is a language I worked on a lot of frameworks with.

That being said, I _know_ how to use these languages too (more like I used them some time ago):
- **Bash**
- **C** (and by extension, C++)
- **Rust**
- **C#**
- **PHP**

### Other Languages

These do not count as programming languages, so they have their own section:
- HTML (and of course, CSS)
- JSON
- Markdown (I mean... this is Markdown, innit?)

### Modules, Libraries and Frameworks

- **Javascript (NodeJS)**
    * ExpressJS
    * Mongoose (MongoDB ORM)
    * Axios
    * Nunjucks
    * Discord.js
    * pm2 (Process Manager)

- **Python**
    * Flask
    * Django
    * Jinja
    * Tkinter
    * Pygame
    * Discord.py 

- **Docker**

### Databases

I am familiar with both SQL and NoSQL databases. Here are the few I have worked with:
- MongoDB
- SQLite
- MySQL

Except for the incomplete repositories in my profile, I have worked mostly on the MASK Website. I have also worked on some Django and Flask websites. I am open to similar projects. If you are interested in something like this, do contact me. I'm available on Discord as `.goose_of_war` and over here on GitHub.  

> _Also, I wouldn't mind if anyone wanted to fork and contribute to the incomplete repositories I have. Definitely not saying this because I'm lazy or something._
