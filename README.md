# _Honk: An intro by yours truly_

### Introduction

:swan:
> A goose who's been through *so much* war that peace is now not an option at all; maybe it never was... 

Feels a bit far-fetched, don't you think? Well... That's more or less what I make myself out to be. In reality, I'm just a guy with glasses doing some simple stuff in my computer. 

Allow me to introduce myself, I am Vidunram, but I go by many nicknames/aliases/whatever you want to call it:
- Shortened forms of my name, like Vidun, Vid, etc.
- **Goos** (I lost that 'e' in the war)
- Of course, the amalgamations which you get when you try to/don't try to but eventually make a mess out of my name... I ain't giving examples for this one. Your imagination itself is good enough for it.

### What do I know?

Well, I have been coding since mid 2019, though I did have computer science courses before that as well. My most proficient language as of now is...

*\*drumroll\**
> :snake: Python (specifically Python 3.X)

To list everything which I have studied/used till date, here's the list:
- :snake: Python (no doubt that this was coming on the list)
- :green_square: Node.js (worked on it mostly while working on the MASK repository)
- :copyright: C/C++ (first year in college; no other emoji except copyright serves the purpose)

Starting from here, the list has stuff which I have bare-minimum knowledge on and am learning them right now
- :video_game: C# (weird choice of an emoji, unless well, Unity, which was what I used it for)
- :computer: Web Development tools (mainly HTML, CSS and JS, and using it in templates.)

> ### _Whatchu got for us, Goose?_

I am not sure about after July 2022, but until the end of July, I'll be posting some small stuff which I'll be doing in Python and some web-dev stuff which I might start working on. These will most probably be really simple stuff and some remastered forms of my old projects, which you can find over here, in a [PasteBin account](https://pastebin.com/u/war_goose).

Until later

Honk
