# Honk!

Welcome to 2023

### Introduction

Hello. I am Vidunram, a second-year undergraduate student of IIT Kharagpur. I mostly work on the back-end of small projects, mainly in Python and Javascript. I am currently a member of the Web Team of the [Manga and Anime Society, Kharagpur](https://github.com/mask-tech) and I am open for small projects to code.

## 
### Languages which I have worked with
- **Python:** Started through the CBSE Computer Science course in 11th and 12th grade, this language is the one which I have worked the most on, ranging from small things like a command-line 'Tower of Hanoi' to [small pygames](https://pastebin.com/E6nquEuJ) and [a Django server](https://github.com/Goose-of-War/django-rstrnt).
- **Javascript:** Despite having worked on Javascript only since August 2022, this one is probably the one where I have worked the most on, especially on the [MASK Website](https://). Mainly working on Node.js and HTML DOM, it has been a fun ride for me so far, working on JS.
- **C(++):** Mainly learned C for the first-year programming course which every one takes. C personally has been helpful since it showed me how beautiful the other languages are, with all the tools they already have (and also because it showed me how much I might have to grind)
- **C#:** There was a brief phase when I was into game-development and I worked on Unity, which more or less used this for scripts. Here's a [small game](https://github.com/Goose-Of-War/Versus-Fighter-0) which I made eons ago (it's a remake of a pygame which I made BTW). It ain't much, but it's honest work. (This phase can be brought back provided I got a good team) 
<br/>

- **HTML/CSS:** While these technically aren't languages like the ones above, I think they deserve the mention, since I have worked on them (and since I am on a web team and worked on them, albeit I worked on templates more than sites themselves)

### What you can find in my repositories 
For the most part, my repositories contain some simple (yet most probably incomplete) code in Python, Django, HTML, CSS, JS, Node.js and that one Unity game. You might probably find some subject notes in the set of repositories as well (What? I'm a nice guy who helps my classmates when I can ;-;) but yeah, that's more or less it. 

_(PS: Half of my repositories contain some incomplete stuff. So you can fork them, make them better and send a PR. Might help you get some brownie points in terms of learning how to use GitHub and stuff. It's most definitely not because I'm lazy to fix them myself (: )_

_As usual, this repository will undergo some changes (be it insignificant or not.) Until then, Honk_
